1.Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
  1.1 Theater, specifically Plays have the highest level of successful and failed funding, evidencing popularity by its numbers.
  1.2 Journalism is represented by canceled funding, showing a total lack of support by backers.
  1.3 There appears to be more funding provided by backers during the February/March period and June/July period.
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
  2.1 I don't know where the data came from, which sources were used.
  2.2 I dont know what specific market trends were the focus, what the questions were that needed to be asked.
  2.3 I suspect my ability to create formulas has been a limitation, am keen to discuss where I could improve/formulas I could have used.
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   Cartesian graphs, histograms, scatter plots, pie charts could have been used.
   These tools would not have easily compared the values visually.
